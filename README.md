# Extension: Spotify Search

This is a small Google Chrome extension. It has two major components, one adds an option to the [context menu]
(https://developer.chrome.com/apps/contextMenus), the other performs logic when the context menu is opened.
The extension is designed this way to minimalize its reasource footprint.  

The extension takes highlighted text and plugs it into Spotify's [URI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/internet-explorer/ie-developer/platform-apis/aa767916(v=vs.85)) to ease transition of searches between web and app.
